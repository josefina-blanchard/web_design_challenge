WeatherPy

In this project I created a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator, utilizing the citipy and openweathermap Python libraries, to create a representative model of weather across world cities.

The objective was to build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

- Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
- Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
- Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
- Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

The data was process as follow:

- Based on latitude and longitude, randomly selected 500 unique cities.
- Using a series of successive API calls, performed a weather check on each of the cities.
- The plots and call results were saved in png and csv files, respectively.
